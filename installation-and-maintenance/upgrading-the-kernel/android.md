# ðŸ“± Android

The only way to upgrade your kernel in Android is to unpack the updated kernel files manually. This method also works for bleeding-edge builds, though you have to use unzip instead. To upgrade, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Ubuntu proot
   * proot-distro login ubuntu
2. Install wget to download the latest release from [this page](https://github.com/Aptivi/Kernel-Simulator/releases). Be sure to get the URL for any .rar file ending with `-dotnet`, such as [this URL](https://github.com/Aptivi/Kernel-Simulator/releases/download/v0.0.24.4-beta/0.0.24.4-bin-dotnet.rar).
   * `apt install wget`
   * `wget https://github.com/Aptivi/Kernel-Simulator/releases/download/v0.x.x.x-beta/0.x.x.x-bin.rar`
3. Use unrar (from multiverse) to extract the files
   * `unrar 0.x.x.x-bin.rar`
4. Execute `dotnet Nitrocid.dll`
