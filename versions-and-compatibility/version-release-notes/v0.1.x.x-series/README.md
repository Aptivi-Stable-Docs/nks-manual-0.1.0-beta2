# ðŸ”® v0.1.x.x series

This kernel series is the first kernel series that actually â€“ and finally â€“ showed seriousness about the beta version of the simulator as outlined in the ancient product documentation dating back to the first ever release, 0.0.1. It added a staggering amount of features that you can't even count! It also brought in massive amounts of improvements to the point that it has been re-imagined like never before!

It also has renewed the look in several ways, including the modern logon screen. It holds under API v3.0, which means that mods that depend on API v2.1 or lower won't work with this version or higher.

### Version 0.1.0

This version is still work in progress, although you can now test the version in beta versions. The below changes will be populated once the beta ends.

We promise that we'll implement several amazing features during the beta periods. If you found any issues or suggestions, report them on GitHub, and we'll consider responding to your requests within the next 24 hours.
